**Graceful degradation:**

Service workers are related with graceful degradation as it can help us if we have an application that uses the internet to get its information like our recipe app in this lab. By using service workers we can implement ways to make the app more accessible to be used without internet or with a slow connection to internet. These services help us make the a fully functional application in the best circumstance work in less ideal conditions which is what graceful degradation is by definition.
